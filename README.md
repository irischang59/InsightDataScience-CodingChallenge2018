# Insight-Coding-Challenge-2018
A Python solution to the Insight Data Engineering coding challenge 2018.

# Description
The two Python scripts are placed in the src folder.  
`h1b_top_10_occupations.py` and `h1b_top_10_states.py` take in an input file and distill it into `top_10_occupations.txt` and `top_10_states.txt`, respectively.  
The two generated outputs can be found in the output folder.

The script can be invoked by running `run.sh` in the top-most directory. Ensure that permissions are set. Changes can be made to this shell script to set your input and output path.

# Dependencies
- Python 2.7
- Numpy
